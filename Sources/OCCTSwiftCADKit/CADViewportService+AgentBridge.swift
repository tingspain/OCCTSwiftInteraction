// CADViewportService+AgentBridge.swift
// OCCTSwiftCADKit
//
// The agent-viewport selection bridge (OCCTSwiftInteraction#16): writes this service's live
// selection out to `selection.json` on every change, watches `<directory>/highlight_requests/`
// for a request an MCP-side agent dropped, and applies each well-formed one via
// `select(_:scheme:)` or `present(_:)`. Split into its own file per this repo's code-structure
// policy, following the same pattern as `+Selection.swift`/`+Escalation.swift`: the wire types
// live in `SelectionSidecar.swift`, this file is the behaviour.
//
// Full wire format: `okf/decisions/agent-viewport-selection-bridge.md` (OCCTSwiftInteraction#17).
//
// macOS-only: built on `OCCTSwiftIO.DirectoryWatcher`, itself gated to macOS (kqueue is a Darwin
// primitive), and `SelectionSidecar.swift`'s `HostLock` (`flock(2)`).
