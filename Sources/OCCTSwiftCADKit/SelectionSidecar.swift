// SelectionSidecar.swift
// OCCTSwiftCADKit
//
// The wire-format data types for the agent-viewport selection bridge (OCCTSwiftInteraction#16),
// per the ADR at `okf/decisions/agent-viewport-selection-bridge.md` in this repo
// (OCCTSwiftInteraction#17). This file holds only the Codable shapes and the small helpers they
// need; the behaviour that reads and writes them lives in `CADViewportService+AgentBridge.swift`,
// the same data-type/behaviour split as `EscalationRequest.swift` / `+Escalation.swift`.
//
// Every type here is `internal`: the sidecar's public surface is
// `CADViewportService.startSelectionSidecar(directory:)`/`stopSelectionSidecar()` alone, per the
// issue. A host that wants to read these files itself reads the JSON directly against the ADR's
// documented shape, rather than linking this package for its wire types.
//
// macOS-only, gated to match `OCCTSwiftIO.DirectoryWatcher`, the dependency the whole feature is
// built on (Darwin-only: kqueue, and `flock(2)` below).
