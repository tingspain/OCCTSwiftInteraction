# Agent-viewport selection bridge file formats

## Status

Accepted. Documentation only: no reader or writer for any of the files below ships in this repo.
The Swift implementation is tracked separately, per repo, and each of those issues cross-references
this doc rather than restating its content:

- This repo's own sidecar work: [OCCTSwiftInteraction#16](https://github.com/SecondMouseAU/OCCTSwiftInteraction/issues/16)
- The MCP-side client (`get_selection` / `highlight_selection`):
  [OCCTMCP#189](https://github.com/SecondMouseAU/OCCTMCP/issues/189) /
  [OCCTMCP#190](https://github.com/SecondMouseAU/OCCTMCP/issues/190)
- ACADStudio's connecting issue (not yet filed as of this writing)

## Context

An agent driving `OCCTMCP` and a human driving a live viewport (`CADViewportService`, or a host
built on it such as ACADStudio) need to agree on one wire format for two things that cross the
process boundary: the human's current selection, and a highlight the agent wants drawn (including
an escalation question). The two processes only share a directory of plain files: the same scene
directory `manifest.json` already lives in, watched today by `OCCTSwiftViewport`'s
`ScriptWatcher`.

This package is where the decision belongs, not a docs-only repo, because it already owns the
durable identity and picking primitives the bridge is built from (`SubShapeRef`, `SubShape`,
`InteractiveObject`, `SubShapePickResolver`) and every consumer of this bridge already depends on
it (`OCCTMCP`, `ACADStudio`, and, via `OCCTSwiftUX`, anything built on top of it). An earlier pass
filed this as `ecosystem#53`, a docs-only repo with no stake in the primitives; that was a mistake
against this doc's own placement and `ecosystem#53` is closed as a duplicate of
[OCCTSwiftInteraction#17](https://github.com/SecondMouseAU/OCCTSwiftInteraction/issues/17), the
issue this doc closes.

`ACADStudio`'s `SceneDirectoryManager` is the precedent for the atomic-write and single-writer
discipline formalized below. `OCCTMCP`'s `SelectionRegistry` / `TopologyAnchor` already define an
analogous `{bodyId, kind, index, uid}` shape for agent-side selections; the entry shape decided
here is kept consistent with it on purpose, so a `get_selection` implementation can mint a
`TopologyAnchor` directly from a `selection.json` entry rather than converting through a third
shape.

## Decision

### Shared scene directory layout

All of the files below live in the same scene directory as `manifest.json`:

```
<scene-directory>/
  manifest.json                    # existing: execute_script / occtkit output
  selection.json                   # host-owned: the human's current live selection
  host.json                        # host-owned: liveness descriptor, written once at startup
  host.lock                        # host-owned: exclusive flock for the host's lifetime
  highlight_requests/
    <id>.json                      # client-owned: a pending highlight/escalation request
    handled/
      <id>.json                   # host-owned: the outcome of a processed request
```

### `selection.json`

The host's current live selection, one object per file:

```json
{
  "revision": 42,
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-21T10:15:32Z",
  "selections": [
    { "bodyId": "part1", "kind": "face", "index": 3, "uid": "b7e2f6a1-..." }
  ]
}
```

- **`selections`**: an array of `{bodyId: String, kind: "face"|"edge"|"vertex"|"body", index: Int,
  uid: String?}` entries, one per currently-selected sub-shape (or body). The `"body"` kind
  represents `SubShape.body` (whole-body selection) and has no corresponding `PickedEntity` case;
  for `"body"`, `index` is ignored (writers emit `0`). Empty array, not a missing key, when
  nothing is selected.
  uid: String?}` entries, one per currently-selected sub-shape (or body). Empty array, not a
  missing key, when nothing is selected.
- **`revision`**: `Int`, monotonic, incremented by exactly 1 on every write of this file, whether or
  not the selection set actually changed. A consumer polling for freshness compares `revision`
  values, never file mtimes.
- **`updatedAt`**: `String`, ISO 8601 UTC (`2026-08-21T10:15:32Z`), the timestamp of the write that
  produced this `revision`.

The host creates this file at startup (`revision: 0`, empty `selections`) alongside its `host.json` write, so a reader never has to treat "file absent" as "nothing selected":
`host.json` write, so a reader never has to treat "file absent" as "nothing selected": file absent
means the host has not started, or is stale (see `host.lock` below); file present with an empty
array means the host is live and nothing is selected.

### `highlight_requests/<id>.json`

A pending highlight (or escalation) request, one file per request, named by its own `id`:

```json
{
  "id": "hl-8f2c1d",
  "bodyId": "part1",
  "kind": "face",
  "index": 3,
  "scheme": "replace",
  "question": null,
  "ifRevision": 7
}
```

- **`id`**: `String`. Always equal to the filename stem (`highlight_requests/<id>.json`); a reader
  that finds a mismatch treats the file as foreign or corrupt and ignores it.
- **`bodyId` / `kind` / `index`**: identical fields and types to a `selection.json` entry, naming
  the single sub-shape (or body) this request targets. No `uid` field: a request is authored by the
  MCP-side client, which mints a request against its own graph, not the host's; the host resolves
  `bodyId`/`kind`/`index` against its own scene independently. See "Index is per-process advisory"
  below.
- **`scheme`**: `"replace" | "add" | "remove" | "xor"`, the same four-scheme vocabulary this
  package's own `InteractiveContext.select(_:scheme:)` already uses. How the requested entity
  combines with whatever the host currently has highlighted.
- **`question`**: `String?`. Present only when this request is escalation-shaped: the host renders
  it exactly as it would render one of its own `EscalationRequest.question` values, and the request
  maps onto a single-entity `EscalationRequest` (`entities: [the one targeted PickedEntity]`,
  `candidates: []`, `context: nil`) rather than this doc inventing a parallel escalation shape.
  `nil` (or the key omitted) for a plain "highlight this" request with no question attached.
- **`ifRevision`**: `Int?`. The `selection.json` revision this request was composed against, when
  the requester wants the apply to be conditional on it. Compare-and-swap.

  The race it closes is one the rest of the protocol cannot see. An agent reads `selection.json`,
  decides what to highlight from what it read, and by the time its request lands the human has
  selected something else. The request still applies, against a premise that is no longer true,
  and reports `applied`. Nothing anywhere records that the premise moved.

  When present, the host writes `{"outcome": "superseded"}` with a reason naming both revisions,
  and applies nothing, if its current revision is **strictly greater** than `ifRevision`. Strictly
  greater rather than unequal, deliberately: a request naming the *current* revision is exactly the
  one still valid, and a request naming a revision *ahead* of the host is not stale but impossible,
  since the only way to author one is to have read a `selection.json` this host did not write. That
  case falls through and applies rather than being reported as staleness it is not.

  Absent (or the key omitted) means unconditional, which is the right default: a request that
  genuinely does not care what the human did in the meantime, clearing a highlight say, should not
  have to pretend it does. The check runs before the target is resolved, so a stale request never
  reports a geometry rejection that would send the requester looking in the wrong place.

For `kind == "body"`, `index` carries no meaning (this package's own `SubShape.body` carries no
`SubShapeRef` at all, for the same reason): writers emit `0`, readers ignore it.

### `highlight_requests/handled/<id>.json`

Written once the host has processed a request, same `<id>` as the request it answers:

```json
{ "outcome": "applied", "reason": null }
```

- **`outcome`**: `"applied" | "rejected" | "superseded"`.
  - `applied`: the host changed its viewport highlight to match the request.
  - `rejected`: the host chose not to apply it (a bad `bodyId`, an out-of-range `index`, a user
    dismissing an escalation question); `reason` should say why.
  - `superseded`: a newer request arrived before the host got to this one, so the host applied the
    newer one instead and never actually processed this request's own content.
- **`reason`**: `String?`. Free text, present when it adds something `outcome` alone doesn't
  already say; `nil` for the ordinary `applied` case.

The handled file does not repeat `id`, `bodyId`, `kind`, or `index`: the filename is the join key
back to the request it answers, and the original request file stays in `highlight_requests/` (it
is not moved or deleted), so a client that wants the full picture reads both files by the same
`<id>`.

### `host.json`

Written once, at host startup, never rewritten while the host is live:

```json
{
  "pid": 4821,
  "startedAt": "2026-08-21T09:58:01Z",
  "hostName": "ACADStudio",
  "hostVersion": "1.4.2",
  "schemaVersion": 1
}
```

- **`pid`**: `Int`, the host process id, cross-checked against `host.lock`'s holder.
- **`startedAt`**: `String`, ISO 8601 UTC, this host process's own start time.
- **`hostName`**: `String`, the host application's name (`"ACADStudio"`, `"OCCTStudio"`, ...).
- **`hostVersion`**: `String`, the host application's own version string.
- **`schemaVersion`**: `Int`, the version of *this* file-format contract the host was built
  against. Starts at `1` for the contract this doc defines. A client reading a `schemaVersion` it
  does not recognize refuses to interpret the rest of the directory rather than guessing.

### `host.lock`

An empty file. The host opens (creating if absent) and holds an exclusive `flock(2)` on it for its
entire process lifetime; the lock is released by the kernel the instant the host process exits or
crashes, with no explicit unlock needed. A client checks liveness by attempting a non-blocking
shared lock: if that lock is obtainable, no host currently holds `host.lock`, and `host.json`'s
`pid`/`startedAt` (and by extension `selection.json`) are stale. `host.lock` carries no content and
is never rewritten; the atomicity rule below does not apply to it, only to the JSON files.

### The atomicity rule

Stated once here, and it governs every JSON file above: **every write is a temp-name-then-`rename(2)`,
never an in-place write.** Concretely: write the new content to a temp file in the same directory
(so the rename stays on one filesystem), then rename it over the target path. Foundation's
`Data.write(to:options:.atomic)` already does exactly this. A reader never observes a
partially-written file, because it either sees the old inode (mid-rename) or the new one, never a
truncated in-progress write.

This applies to `selection.json`, `host.json`, every `highlight_requests/<id>.json`, and every
`highlight_requests/handled/<id>.json`. It does not apply to `host.lock`, whose atomicity comes from
`flock(2)` itself, not from a rename.

### The single-writer rule

Exactly one side writes each path:

| Path | Sole writer |
|---|---|
| `selection.json` | the host |
| `host.json` | the host |
| `host.lock` | the host (holds the lock; does not rewrite content) |
| `highlight_requests/<id>.json` (excluding `handled/`) | the MCP-side client |
| `highlight_requests/handled/<id>.json` | the host |

Nothing here is ever written by both sides. A request file and its handled file are the one
two-writer conversation this contract has, and it stays race-free because each side only ever
writes the path the other side only ever reads: the client creates `<id>.json` and never touches
`handled/<id>.json`; the host reads `<id>.json`, may delete it once handled (implementation detail,
not part of this contract) and writes `handled/<id>.json` exactly once.

## Design notes

**Index is per-process advisory; `uid` is the durable identity, when present.** This mirrors
`SubShapeRef`'s own documented split in this package: **the shape is the identity and the ordinal
is advisory, not the other way round.** `index` in every shape above is an ordinal in whichever
process wrote it (the host's tessellation-time ordinal for `selection.json`, the MCP-side client's
own graph-node index for a `highlight_requests/<id>.json` it authored), and the two are not
guaranteed to be the same index space. A consumer resolves by `uid` first whenever one is present,
and treats `index` as a best-effort fallback scoped to whichever side minted it, never as a value
safe to compare across the two processes directly.

**`uid`, when present, is a `BRepGraph.GraphUID` and inherits its persistence caveat.**
**`uid`, when present, is a `BRepGraph.GraphUID` (from OCCTSwift) and inherits its persistence caveat.
`BRepGraph.GraphUID` is `Codable` but instance-scoped: it does not survive a graph rebuild or a
process restart, so a `uid` written by one host process lifetime is not guaranteed to resolve
against a graph rebuilt in a later one. A reader that gets a `uid` miss falls back to
`bodyId`/`kind`/`index`, exactly the rung-2/rung-3 fallback `OCCTMCP`'s own `remap_selection`
already uses for the equivalent problem one layer up.

## Not included

- The Swift implementation of any reader or writer: see the issues cross-referenced under
  "Status" above.
- A heartbeat/staleness threshold for a non-local (network- or sync-backed) scene directory. Out of
  scope until that case is real; `host.lock` plus `host.json`'s `pid` covers the single-machine case
  this bridge is built for.
- A versioning/migration strategy for the schema itself, beyond the `schemaVersion` field already
  specified above.
