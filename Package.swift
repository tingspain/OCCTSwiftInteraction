// swift-tools-version: 6.1

import PackageDescription
// Every dependency resolves from its published URL. NEVER from a `../<name>` sibling.
//
// The old helper preferred a sibling checkout when one existed, so the fleet would share the
// single OCCT.xcframework instead of each repo extracting its own (SecondMouseAU/ecosystem#8).
// The saving is real but bought in the wrong currency: a path dependency carries no version
// requirement, so SwiftPM compiles whatever happens to be checked out in that sibling and drops
// the pin from Package.resolved entirely. Committing that lockfile makes the repo unresolvable
// from any clean checkout, which is CI and every new clone.
//
// Not hypothetical: PadCAM's `main` was unresolvable for exactly this reason and nobody noticed,
// because everyone builds with siblings present. Four incidents in two days built stale sibling
// source (ecosystem#48), and four OCCTParts branches shipped a Package.resolved with every
// occtswift pin stripped, caught by a review bot reading the diff rather than by any check
// (ecosystem#51).
//
// Measured, which is what settles it: the artifact DOWNLOAD is already shared, in
// ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/artifacts, so a URL-resolved build reports
// "Fetched ... from cache" and touches no network. Sibling resolution only ever saved the
// per-project EXTRACTION, about 594 MB in .build/artifacts/. That is disk worth paying for a
// lockfile that means what it says, and it is separately recoverable by sharing the extraction
// (symlink or APFS clone) without substituting source at all.
//
// Ed's rule, 2026-08-20: nothing resolves locally except binaries, and the binary is already
// shared by the artifact cache. The helper is kept rather than reverted to a bare
// `.package(url:)` so the call sites stay identical across the fleet.

// OCCTSwiftInteraction: identity, selection, and the assembled CAD viewport service.
//
// One package, three targets, strict upward dependency direction:
//
//   OCCTSwiftTools     kernel-to-renderer bridge: Shape into ViewportBody with picking metadata,
//                      plus the Face/Edge/VertexIdentityTables that give a picked ordinal a durable
//                      topological identity. No UI framework of any kind.
//     └─ OCCTSwiftAIS  interactive services: selection state, modes, schemes, filters, area
//                      selection, manipulator widgets, dimensions. Modeled on OCCT's own AIS_*.
//          └─ OCCTSwiftCADKit   the assembled SwiftUI CAD viewport service: import, face/edge/vertex
//                               picking, clipping, camera framing.
//
// **These were three separate repositories until ecosystem#42.** They were merged because the
// boundaries between them are real but the packaging of them was not: three version lines that only
// ever moved together, three release cuts that had to happen in strict order, and three CI setups.
// A single cross-cutting change (the picking consolidation, ecosystem#43) would otherwise need six
// sequenced PRs across three repos with a release between each. OCCTSwiftTools was 1,123 lines
// across 9 files, carrying more repository overhead than code.
//
// The merge deliberately does NOT collapse the modules. Each stays a SwiftPM target, so the layering
// is still enforced by the compiler exactly as strictly as it was across package boundaries, and a
// headless consumer depending only on the `OCCTSwiftTools` product still compiles no SwiftUI:
// SwiftPM builds only the targets reachable from the products you actually name. Module names are
// unchanged, so every consumer keeps its existing `import OCCTSwiftTools` / `import OCCTSwiftAIS` /
// `import OCCTSwiftCADKit` lines and changes only the package reference in its own manifest.
//
// Modeled on OCCTSwiftUX, which has vended six targets from one package since well before this.

    // OCCTSwift's own v3.0.0 release notes open with "macOS / iOS (device + simulator)". Anything
    // linking the kernel on visionOS or tvOS cannot link at all.

    // as not to regress the two targets with the most dependents. That reasoning was wrong in a way
    // invisible from the manifests: the wider claim was never true for any of the three, so there
    // was nothing to regress. Root cause is filed upstream as
    // https://github.com/SecondMouseAU/OCCTSwift/issues/978.
